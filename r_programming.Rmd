# **R Programming - Conditions**



- **Comparison Operators **
    - equal (**==**)
    - not equal (**!=**)
    - greater or equal to (**>=**)
    - lower or equal to (**<=**)


- **Logical Operators **
    - the and operator (**&**)
    - the or operator (**|**)
    - the not operator (**!**)

- ***if*** (Stand-Alone) Statement
- ***else*** Statement
- ***ifelse*** Statement


```
TRUE & TRUE  
TRUE & FALSE
TRUE | FALSE 
!TRUE

2 == 3
5 < 6

c(1,4) >= 6

9 != 8

5 < 6 & 9 != 8
```
```
score <- 80
exam_no <- 2

score >= 75 | exam_no == 1

score>=75 & score<90 | exam_no==1
```

***

### ***if*** (Stand-Alone) Statement

The ***if statement*** executes a chunk of code if and only if a defined condition is **TRUE**, which looks something like this:

![](Presentation/if1.png)



```{r, echo=TRUE}
if(TRUE) message("It was true!")

if(FALSE) message("It wasn't true!")

if(TRUE&FALSE) message("It was true!")

if(TRUE|FALSE) message("It doesn't matter")

```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- 3
num <- 4

if ( a != num ) {
print(a)
}
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- 3
num <- 4

if ( a <= num ) {
a <- a ^ 2
print(a)
}
```

***

### ***if*** (Stand-Alone) Statement

![](Presentation/if1a.png)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
num <- -1

if ( num < 0 ) {
  print("num is negative.")
  print("Don't worry, I'll fix it.") 
  num <- num * -1
  print("Now num is positive.")
}
num
```

### ***if*** (Stand-Alone) Statement

![](Presentation/if1c.png)

Try it

Is it in the range ?

```

x <- 6
y <- 2

if ( x > 3 & x == 7 ) {
  print("It is in the range")
  z <- x + y
  print(z)
}

```


Is it in the range ?

```{r, echo=TRUE}

x <- 6
y <- 2

if ( x > 3 & x <= 7 ) {
  print("It is in the range")
  z <- x + y
  print(z)
}

```



Try it

You have a fruit which is yellow.

Is that a banana?

Or an orange ?

```
banana <- "yellow"
my_fruit <- "yellow"

if ( my_fruit == banana ) {
  print("Your fruit might be a banana")
}

```

```
orange <- "orange"
my_fruit <- "yellow"

if ( my_fruit == orange ) {
  print("Your fruit is not a banana")
}

```



***

### ***else*** - Statement

If you want something different to happen when the condition
is **FALSE**, you can add an else declaration.

![](Presentation/if2.png)




```{r, echo=TRUE}
if(FALSE)
    {
      message("This won't execute...")
} else
    {
      message("but this will.")
}
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- 3.5
b <- 0.5

if (a <= 0.5) {
  c <- b + 1
  print(c)
} else {
  c <- b
  print(c)
}
```


Let's say we have two conditions. **Rainy** or **Shiny**. 

And you have recorded **4 mm** precipitation.

```
weather <-       # mm           # fill this number

if ( ) {                        # fill this condition, using weather
  print("it is rainy")
} else {
  print("it is shiny")
}
```



Report the weather. Is it rainy ?

![](if2.png){width=80%}

Let's say we have two conditions. **Rainy** or **Shiny**. 

And you have recorded 4 mm precipitation.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
weather <- 4      # mm              # fill this number

if ( weather > 0 ) {                # fill this condition, using weather
  print("it is rainy")              
} else {
  print("it is shiny")
}
```



***

### -***else ***-  and -***else if***- Statement

![](Presentation/if2a.png)

If your situation has more than two mutually exclusive cases, 
use **else** and **if** statements together.

![](Presentation/if2a_v2.png)


```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- 1                  # team 'a' has 1 goal
b <- 1                  # team 'b' has 1 goal

if (a > b) { 
  print("A wins!")
} else if (a < b) { 
  print("B wins!")
} else {
  print("Tie.")
}
```


**What do you gonna do ? Eating, Sleeping, or Reading?**

When do you want to read ?

- When you are hungry, or sleepy. **No.**
- When you are not hungry and sleepy. **Yes.**

So, start to think about your feelings about sleeping or eating to decide whether reading or not.    
    

## -***else ***-  and -***else if***- Statement

**What do you gonna do ? Eating, Sleeping, or Reading?**

Let's start with define the conditions

  - If you are hungry --> eat
  - If you are sleepy --> sleep
  
    - If you are hungry and sleepy --> ?
    - If you are hungry but not sleepy --> ?
    - If you are not hungry but sleepy --> ?
    - If you are not hungry and sleepy --> ?


What do you gonna do ? Eat, Sleep or Read? 

- If you are hungry and sleepy --> eat
- If you are hungry but not sleepy --> eat
- If you are not hungry but sleepy --> sleep
- If you are not hungry and sleepy --> read

Let's define your feelings. **Yes** (TRUE,1) or **No** (FALSE,0)

- Are you hungry ? 
- Are you sleepy ? 


```
hungry <-                   # TRUE or FALSE (1 or 0)
sleepy <-                   # TRUE or FALSE (1 or 0)


```

What do you gonna do ? Eat, Sleep or Read? 

- 1) If you are hungry and sleepy --> eat
- 2) If you are hungry but not sleepy --> eat
- 3) If you are not hungry but sleepy --> sleep
- 4) If you are not hungry and sleepy --> read

```
hungry <- TRUE                  # Yes , TRUE , 1
sleepy <- TRUE                  # Yes , TRUE , 1

if ( ) { 
  print(" ")
} else if ( ) { 
  print(" ")
} else if ( ) { 
  print(" ")
} else {
  print(" ")
}
```


What do you gonna do ? Eat, Sleep or Read? 

- 1) If you are hungry and sleepy --> eat
- 2) If you are hungry but not sleepy --> eat
- 3) If you are not hungry but sleepy --> sleep

```
hungry <- TRUE                  # Yes , TRUE , 1
sleepy <- TRUE                  # Yes , TRUE , 1

if ( ) {                    # hungry is TRUE and sleepy is TRUE
  print(" ")
} else if ( ) {             # hungry is TRUE and sleepy is FALSE
  print(" ")
} else if ( ) {             # hungry is FALSE and sleepy is TRUE
  print(" ") 
} else {                    # hungry is FALSE and sleepy is FALSE
  print(" ")
}
```

What do you gonna do ? Eat, Sleep or Read? 

- If you are hungry and sleepy --> eat
- If you are hungry but not sleepy --> eat
- If you are not hungry but sleepy --> sleep
- If you are not hungry and sleepy --> read

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hungry <- TRUE                  # Yes , TRUE , 1

} else {                                    # hungry is FALSE and sleepy is FALSE
  print(" ")
}
```



What do you gonna do ? Eat, Sleep or Read? 

- If you are hungry and sleepy --> eat
- If you are hungry but not sleepy --> eat
- If you are not hungry but sleepy --> sleep
- If you are not hungry and sleepy --> read

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hungry <- TRUE                  # Yes , TRUE , 1
sleepy <- TRUE                  # Yes , TRUE , 1

if (hungry==TRUE & sleepy==TRUE) {          # hungry is TRUE and sleepy is TRUE
  print("EAT")
} else if (hungry==TRUE & sleepy==FALSE) {  # hungry is TRUE and sleepy is FALSE
  print("EAT")
} else if (hungry==FALSE & sleepy==TRUE) {  # hungry is FALSE and sleepy is TRUE
  print("SLEEP") 
} else {                                    # hungry is FALSE and sleepy is FALSE

###  Practice - Conditions - TRUE and FALSE



1. **Print** this **if** it is **TRUE.**
"This message will print!"

```
if (...) {
  print(...)
} 
```
2. Go to sleep if it is TRUE, else wake up.

```
if (...) {
   print("Go to sleep!")
} else {
   print("Wake up!")
}
```

3. The variable message to *"I print this when it is false!"* when the condition is **FALSE**.

```
if (...) {
  print("I print this when it is true!")
} else {
  print(...)
}
```

###  Practice - Conditions - Logical Op

**ROLE PLAY** : You are a CAR, and you are going on the road. 

![](Presentation/car.png)



Problem : **BUT** ;

- Traffic (stop) light turned to **orange**
- **Two** pedestrians started to walk across the road

**How can you move ?**

- Waiting for the traffic (stop) light turns to **green**
- Waiting for pedestrians pass to the across of the road

**Parameters** : 

- The **COLOR** of the traffic (stop) light
- The **NUMBER** of pedestrians



You are a CAR, **BUT** ;

- Traffic (stop) light turned to **orange**
- **Two** pedestrians started to walk across the road

**Parameters** : 

- The **COLOR** of the traffic (stop) light
- The **NUMBER** of pedestrians

*First, define the situation*

```{r, echo=T}
Traffic_Stop_Light <- 'orange'
Number_of_Pedestrians <- 2
```




You are a CAR, **BUT** ;

```{r, echo=T}
Traffic_Stop_Light <- 'orange'
Number_of_Pedestrians <- 2
```

*Second, define the conditions to move again*

```
Traffic_Stop_Light : ?
Number_of_Pedestrians : ?
```

##  Practice - Conditions - Logical Op

Situation
```{r, echo=T}
Traffic_Stop_Light <- 'orange'
Number_of_Pedestrians <- 2
```



Condition
```
Traffic_Stop_Light : 'green'
Number_of_Pedestrians : 0
```

Remember rules
```
if (...) {
  print(...);
} else {
  print(...);
}
```



Situation
```{r, echo=T}
Traffic_Stop_Light <- 'orange'
Number_of_Pedestrians <- 2
```

Condition
```
Traffic_Stop_Light : 'green'

###  Practice - Conditions - Logical Op

**Problem** : You want to enjoy, and let's say the day is;

```{r, echo=T}
day <- "Friday"
```

What do you gonna do **if** it is **Friday**.
```
if (...) {
  print('Enjoy the weekend!')
} else {
  print('Do some work.')
}
```



***

```{r, echo=T}
day <- "Friday"

  print('Do some work.')
}
```


***

### Practice - Conditions - Logical Op

**ANSWER** : You want to enjoy, and let's say the day is;

```{r, echo=T}
day <- "Friday"
```

It is okay, you can fun **if** it is **weekend**.
```{r, echo=T}
if (day == 'Saturday' | day == 'Sunday') {
  print('Enjoy the weekend!')
} else {
  print('Do some work.')
}
```

###  Practice - Conditions - Logical Op

**Problem** : You want to go out and your question is 

**"Should I take an umbrella?"**

**Note** : There are two variables in your code,

**"sky"** (*character*) and **"high_chance_of_rain"** (*logical*)

- Check, if "**sky**" is equal to "**cloudy**" and, whether there is a "**high_chance_of_rain**".
- If both are true, the code should print: **"Take umbrella!"**
- Otherwise, the code should print: **"No need for umbrella!"**
- Based on the condition, what is the answer?

        RADIO: The sky is cloudy and the chance of rain is high.

### **R Programming - <span style="color:green">*while*</span> Loops** 


```{r}
coins <- 3
game <- 0

while(coins >= 0)
{
  coins <- coins -1
  game <- game + 1
  print(game)
  print("nice try, play again")
}

### **R Programming - <span style="color:green">*for*</span> Loops**

The third type of loop is to be used when you know exactly how many times you want the code to repeat.

### **R Programming - <span style="color:green">*apply*</span> Loops**

- The **apply()** functions form the basis of more complex combinations and helps to perform operations with very few lines of code. 
- More specifically, the family is made up of the **apply()**, **lapply()** , **sapply()**, **vapply()**, **mapply()**, **rapply()**, and **tapply()** functions.

```
apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...)

# X is an array or a matrix, dim(X) must have a positive length
# MARGIN=1, it applies over rows, whereas with 
# MARGIN=2, it works over columns. Note that when you use the construct 
# MARGIN=c(1,2), it applies to both rows and columns
# FUN, which is the function that you want to apply to the data. 
```

```
apply(precip_2b_summer, MARGIN=1, mean)
apply(precip_2b_summer, MARGIN=2, mean)
apply(precip_2b_summer, MARGIN=c(1,2), mean)
apply(precip_2b_summer, MARGIN=c(2,1), mean)
```

**Practice** : Write A Function - 3

- I have four different numbers w,x,y,z
- I want to define them WHEN I am using the function
- I want to calculate w+x IN function
- I want to calculate y*z IN function
- I want to print the results IN function


```{r}
my_fun3 <- function(w,x,y,z){
  
result1 <- w+x
result2 <- y*z

print(result1)
print(result2)

}

# my_fun3()
my_fun3(1,2,3,4)
```

 BONUS

- menu() function


```
menu(c("Yes", "No"), title="What dou you think?")
menu1 <- menu(c("Yes", "No"), title="What dou you think?")
menu1

menu(c("Option1","Option2","Option3","Option4"), title="Choose one of them")
menu2 <- menu(c("Option1","Option2","Option3","Option4"), title="Choose one of them")
menu2

```

***

- I have two different numbers x,y
- I want to define them WHEN I am using the function
- I want to define ONE calculation DURING the function
- I want to print the results IN function

```
my_fun3 <- function(x,y){

math <- menu(c("+", "-", "*", "/"), title="Which calculation?")

  if (math==1) {
    result <- x+y
  } else if ( ) {
     
  } else if ( ) {
    
  } else  {
    
  }

print(result)
}
```
